# Learn GPT

Welcome to my project! I am learning GPT by implementing it from scratch.

## Overview

This project is a hands-on approach to understanding and building the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model. By working through the implementation details, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of how GPT works.

## Goals

- Understand the architecture of GPT
- Implement GPT from scratch
- Experiment with different configurations and datasets
- Document the learning process and findings

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the setup guide.

## Progress

I will be updating this README with my progress and any important notes as I continue to learn and implement GPT.

Stay tuned!
